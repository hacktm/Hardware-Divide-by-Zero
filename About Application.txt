 This application tests the CPU performance of a computer CPU.
On the algorithmic part, the CPU has to check if numbers from 1 to 32 are Prime numbers and further on if they are Mersenne Prime numbers.And for each loop returns a time.
The score is determined by the total time from all the loops. The lower is the score , the faster is the CPU. 
On the embedded part, the arduino communicates via serial with the application and automates the test sequence.
If the RED LED is blinking continously - CPU testing is in progress
if the YELLOW LED is blinking with a higher delay - application is in stand by 
If the GREEN LED is ON - testing has finished and a chart has been generated. 

The buttons can be used to operate the application manually.
